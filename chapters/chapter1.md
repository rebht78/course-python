<exercise id="4" title="Practice on Variables">

In this exercise, We'll be working with variables.

Create two variables - ```first_number``` and ```second_number```. Assign value of 5 to them.

Also, create another variable ```result```. ```result``` variable will store addition of ```first_number```
and ```second_number```.

<codeblock id="01_04">

To simple create variables, you have to use the name and assign it the value using ```=```.
