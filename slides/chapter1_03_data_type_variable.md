# Variables and Data Types

Notes: We have written simple programs in Python (we've used only ```print``` function). More complex programs work on data. Data such as Student's marks, names and ID. 

In the subsequent slides, We'll understand how to work with Data in Python; We'll be learning Variables and Data Types.

# What are Variables?

- A _Variable_ is a named container that store values.
- Every Variable in Python has: 
    - a name
    - a type
    - a memory location

Notes: Python is different from languages such as C, C++, Java, etc. when it comes to dealing with variables. We will be learning more about how Python deals with Variables.

# How to declare a variable?

```python
# If you need to create a variable, think of any name and declare it 
# also, you have to give a default value.
first_variable = 23
print(first_variable)
```

```out
23
```

Notes: Take note that when you are declaring a variable, you are not stating that the variable
```first_variable``` is equal to 23. What the statement actually means is “assign the value of ```23``` to ```first_variable```”.

# Variables (contd.)

Let's assign new value to ```first_variable```. We will be assigning ```'Sherlock'``` to ```first_variable```

```python
first_variable = 23
print(first_variable) # this will print 23
first_variable = 'Sherlock'
print(first_variable) # this will print Sherlock
```

```out
23
Sherlock
```

# Data Types

In this section, We will be learning following types in Python:

- int
- str
- float
- bool

Above list is not exhaustive, We'll be learning few more types in the subsequent chapters.
